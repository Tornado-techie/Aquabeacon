# AquaBeacon Photo Upload System - Complete Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview
Your AquaBeacon application now has a **fully functional photo upload system** that supports anonymous reporting with comprehensive file handling and validation.

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### 1. **Anonymous Photo Upload Support**
- ‚úÖ Anonymous users can upload photos with complaints
- ‚úÖ No authentication required for photo uploads
- ‚úÖ Photos are properly associated with anonymous complaints

### 2. **User Interface Components**
- ‚úÖ **PhotoUpload.jsx** - New reusable component with:
  - Drag & drop functionality
  - File preview with thumbnails
  - Progress indicators
  - File validation feedback
  - Remove/replace functionality

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Complaints.jsx** - Updated with:
  - Photo preview integration
  - Better file handling
  - Improved user experience

### 3. **Backend Infrastructure**
- ‚úÖ **S3/MinIO Integration** - Complete file storage system:
  - Secure file uploads to cloud storage
  - Proper file organization (complaints/photos/)
  - Metadata tracking for file management
  
- ‚úÖ **File Validation** - Comprehensive security:
  - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
  - File size limits (10MB per photo)
  - Maximum file count (5 photos per submission)
  - Virus scanning ready

- ‚úÖ **Database Schema** - MongoDB support:
  - Photos array in Complaint model
  - Metadata storage (URL, S3 key, upload date)
  - Anonymous submission tracking

### 4. **API Endpoints**
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/complaints` - Submit complaint with photos
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/complaints/upload-photos` - Dedicated photo upload
- ‚úÖ Multipart form data handling
- ‚úÖ Anonymous submission support

## üîß MongoDB Connection Status

**‚úÖ NO ADDITIONAL MONGODB CONFIGURATION NEEDED**

Your MongoDB setup already supports photo uploads because:

1. **Existing Schema**: The `Complaint` model already includes a `photos` array field
2. **Metadata Storage**: Only photo metadata is stored in MongoDB (not the actual files)
3. **S3 Integration**: Actual photo files are stored in S3/MinIO
4. **Anonymous Support**: The `isAnonymous` field already supports anonymous submissions

### Database Structure:
```javascript
Complaint: {
  // ... other fields
  photos: [{
    url: String,        // S3 URL for accessing the photo
    s3Key: String,      // S3 key for file management
    originalName: String, // Original filename
    size: Number,       // File size in bytes
    uploadedAt: Date    // Upload timestamp
  }],
  isAnonymous: Boolean  // Supports anonymous submissions
}
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Anonymous Users:
1. Visit the Complaints page
2. Fill out the complaint form
3. Drag & drop photos or click to select
4. Photos will show previews immediately
5. Submit the complaint (photos upload automatically)

### For Developers:
1. Use the `PhotoUpload` component anywhere you need file uploads:
```jsx
import PhotoUpload from '../components/common/PhotoUpload';

<PhotoUpload
  onFilesChange={handleFilesChange}
  maxFiles={5}
  maxSizeMB={10}
/>
```

## üåê Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
# S3/MinIO Configuration
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000  # Your MinIO URL
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
S3_BUCKET_NAME=aquabeacon
S3_REGION=us-east-1
```

## üìù Testing the System

### Quick Test:
1. Start your server: `npm run dev` (in server directory)
2. Start your client: `npm start` (in client directory)
3. Go to the Complaints page
4. Try uploading a photo
5. Check the browser network tab to see the upload request

### Verify S3 Storage:
- Photos are stored in: `{bucket}/complaints/photos/`
- Each photo gets a unique filename
- Metadata is saved to MongoDB
